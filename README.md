Instructions:

1. Download the PHPMailer folder from the "KEAN-Project-PHPMailer" repository.

2. Inside the PHPMailer folder you downloaded, there may be another folder also named "PHPMailer."

3. Copy the inner "PHPMailer" folder (the one containing all the files) and paste it directly into the "Kean" folder in your project.

Important:
- Do not paste the outer "PHPMailer" folder. Only paste the folder that contains the actual PHPMailer files.
- The same applies to the "Kean" folder from the "KEAN-Project" repositoryâ€”only paste the folder that contains the actual Kean files, not any outer folders.
